# React Router v6 Nested Route and Wildcard Path Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using nested routes and wildcard paths ('/*') with React Router v6.  The issue occurs when a wildcard path is used in conjunction with other, more specific routes. This leads to unexpected routing behavior where other routes fail to match or the application renders incorrectly.

## Bug Description

The problem lies in the combination of a wildcard route and other, less general routes within the `<Routes>` component.  The wildcard route seems to unintentionally capture or interfere with the routing of more specific paths, leading to incorrect rendering or other issues.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the various routes to observe the issue.
